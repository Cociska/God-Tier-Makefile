> **Stop just compiling.**  
> Turn your terminal into a complete productivity dashboard for C development.

A universal **Makefile** + a suite of **Bash scripts** to supercharge your workflow (especially handy for **Epitech**, **42**, and bigger C projects).  
It covers compilation, testing, Git ergonomics, focus timers, and a few fun terminal utilities.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: navigate all commands using a fuzzy finder menu (`make menu`).
- **Live Monitoring**: auto-recompile your project on every file save (`make auto_build`).
- **Git Automation**: manage branches, commits, and history visually without leaving the terminal.
- **Quality Assurance**: one-command Valgrind leak checks, Criterion tests, coverage, Dockerized execution.
- **Focus Mode**: integrated Pomodoro timer with optional “Lofi Girl” radio streaming.

## 🚀 Installation

This Makefile relies on external scripts and system tools (FZF, Python, etc.).  
**You must run the installer first.**

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cociska/God-Tier-Makefile.git
cd God-Tier-Makefile
```

### 2) Run the automated installer

This script installs system dependencies (FZF, Valgrind, Inotify, MPV...), Python requirements (`yt-dlp`),  
and deploys scripts to `~/Makefile/scripts`.

```bash
./install.sh
```


---

## 📖 Use it in your project

This Makefile is **portable**. Once installed, you can use it in any C project.

### 1) Copy the Makefile into your project root

```bash
cp ~/God-Tier-Makefile/Makefile ./MyProject/
```

### 2) Edit variables at the top of the `Makefile`

```makefile
# Name of your binary
NAME      = my_program

# Your source files
SRC       = src/main.c \
            src/utils.c \
            ...
```

### 3) Launch the dashboard

```bash
make menu
```
